https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/frog-oil-lamp,"""Frog"" oil lamp ","This ovoid-shaped lamp, decorated with a frog framed by a vine scroll, was made in Egypt during the Roman era. Like vine fronds, frogs symbolized rebirth and resurrection, hence their use on Christian lamps."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/twenty-squares-game-board,"""Twenty Squares"" game board ","The game of ""Twenty Squares"" was played at home or among friends, and was one of the Egyptians' favorite pastimes. Some examples of such everyday items from the world of the living have been discovered in villages and fortresses, sometimes engraved on paved floors; others, unearthed in a funerary context, were part of the deceased's funerary equipment, and have usually been found complete with game pieces: pawns, throwsticks, or knucklebones."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/akhenaton-and-nefertiti,Akhenaton and Nefertiti ,"To the visitor to the Louvre who wishes to see Nefertiti, the Department of Antiquities can offer only this group, which shows Akhenaton and his wife, side by side, holding hands, and looking straight ahead. This small sculpture bears witness to the specific religious practices of Akhenaton's time: it would have been made for a private altar, before which a family offered its devotions to the royal couple."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/amenophis-iv,Amenophis IV ,"This pillar fragment comes from a building constructed east of the Temple of Amon at Karnak. It represents the face of Amenophis IV-Akhenaten, in the easily-recognizable Amarna style. In the early years of his reign, the Pharaoh imposed the monotheistic cult of the god Re, whose visible manifestation on earth was the sun-disk, Aten. At the same time, he changed his name from Amenophis to Akhenaten."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/amulet-belonging-paser-form-papyrus-stalk,"Amulet belonging to Paser, in the form of a papyrus stalk ","This ""wadj"" amulet consists of a little column in the form of a papyrus stalk. It is made of amazonite (a stone of an almost turquoise blue-green color) and is of remarkable craftsmanship. It is set with gold in several places, notably where leaflets surround the base of the shaft and umbel; the details are painstakingly engraved. It belonged to the vizier Paser, a key figure during the reign of Ramesses II."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/angle-harp,Angle harp ,"The harp may have been the Egyptians' favorite musical instrument and was represented on paintings and relief sculptures as early as the Old Kingdom. The trigon appeared much later during the New Kingdom. This angular shape, with a vertical sound box, came from the East. The instrument in the Louvre is the only example of its type in such good condition."

And so it was done."" This is the beginning of the first horizontal line that stands at the top of the wall inscribed with the annals of Thutmosis III, the principal text of which reads from top to bottom and from right to left."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/aphrodite-anadyomene,Aphrodite Anadyomene ,"The Greek goddess Aphrodite was born of the foam created when the severed genitals of Uranus were cast into the sea. She is portrayed here in a large shell, upheld by two proud-looking sea monsters. Like the other Olympian gods introduced by Alexander the Great, Aphrodite was worshipped both by the Greeks of Egypt and by the Egyptians themselves. She was adopted and adapted by the Christian world, and came to symbolize the purified soul emerging from the baptismal waters."

https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bas-relief-prince-khaemwaset,Bas-relief of Prince Khaemwaset ,"This bas relief depicts a high priest of Ptah. The side braid and the necklace featuring a dog with raised paws are characteristic emblems of this rank. An inscription identifies the figure as Khaemwaset, fourth son of Ramesses II, who restored many old monuments. He became known as a scholar and magician for this work, a reputation that lasted more than 1,000 years after his death. A treasure in his name, discovered at the Serapeum of Memphis, is exhibited in the same showcase."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bas-reliefs-temple-satet-elephantine,Bas-reliefs from the Temple of Satet at Elephantine ,"This element belongs to a group of eleven blocks acquired by the Louvre after the division of excavation finds. The ""raised relief"" technique was used to portray the pharaoh, wearing the blue crown, and framed by two deities, each with a hand on his shoulder. This was probably a portrait of Queen Hatshepsut - a rarity at the Louvre. This beautiful and well preserved relief still bears traces of the original polychrome."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/base-and-feet-colossus-name-amenophis-iii,Base and feet of a colossus in the name of Amenophis III ,"This base belonged to one of the granite colossi erected by Amenophis III in the temple of the royal cult. The sides are engraved with a list of the southern peoples under his dominion. The cartouches inscribed on the flat of the plinth cover a former inscription, which indicates that this colossus was re-used by Amenophis III."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bastet,Bastet ,"This elegant bronze statuette, an image of the goddess Bastet, combines the body of a woman in a close-fitting dress with the delightful head of a little cat with pricked ears. She holds a sistrum, a lion-headed aegis, and a basket. This is one of the very many figurines that were made during the Late Period and placed by the faithful as ex-votos in the goddess’s temples."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bead-net-mummy,Bead net for a mummy ,"The Egyptians of the Dynastic Period had always been fond of jewelry in faience, a quartz-based ceramic with brilliant colors, but it was not until the 1st millennium BC that jewelry was applied over the last shroud, protecting the mummy with symbols of the great gods of the hereafter."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/beaker-found-cemetery-sai-island,Beaker found in a cemetery on Sai Island ,"This piece of pottery with its remarkable metallic sheen is typical of the ceramic ware of the peoples who lived south of the second cataract between 2500 and 1500 BC. This civilization, known as the Kerma Culture, was named after a great city, which was no doubt its capital during the final phase of its existence. The population derived its wealth from breeding livestock. There was no writing system, so archaeological vestiges are our only source of information."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/body-woman-probably-nefertiti,"Body of a Woman, probably Nefertiti ","This piece of sculpture illustrates the level of skill achieved by certain artists during the el-Amarna period. The sculptor fully mastered the style and strictly applied the canons imposed by the new doctrine. The secret of this work's success lies in the delicate volumes: the shape of the body's lower limbs is underscored by the drapery of the clothing, which is slightly incised in the red sandstone. This expansive female body is generally identified as Nefertiti, wife of Amenophis IV- Akhenat"
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/book-mythological-images-name-nespakashuty-accountant-granaries-amun,"Book of mythological images in the name of Nespakashuty, accountant of the granaries of Amun ","This papyrus belongs to a category of funerary books dating from the 21st Dynasty, known as ""mythological papyri."" These are characterized by the preponderance of image over text. They contain vignettes taken from previous funerary books (in this case, the goddess Nut giving the deceased water to drink) together with mythological scenes (here, the creation of the world)."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/bowl-general-djehuty,Bowl of General Djehuty ,"This shallow, straight-edged bowl (a form which was also discovered at Ugarit) names Djehuty, a famous general in the service of Tuthmosis III. Various museums now own a number of precious objects which once belonged to him and were probably found in his tomb (whose whereabouts is unknown). After his death, General Djehuty entered Egyptian legend as the hero of a story, the text of which has come down to us."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cartonnage-ankhpakhered-barber-amun,"Cartonnage of Ankhpakhered, a barber of Amun ","This brightly colored cartonnage contained the mummy of an Egyptian named Ankhpakhered. It depicts the deceased wrapped in his shroud. A floral band wraps around the tripartite wig. Two falcons, with extended wings and wearing sun disk crowns, are placed just below the wide necklace covering his chest; one has a ram's head. The rest of the cartonnage is decorated with various protective images, predominantly goddess's wings and Osirian emblems."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cat,Cat ,"This haughty and elegant seated cat is one of many ex-votoes from the Late Period (664-332 BC); these objects were placed in the temples to Bastet to honor the goddess and earn her protection for the donor. Admire the brilliant workmanship of the Saite bronzesmith; the pure lines and extremely smooth finish on this sculpture endow this small domestic animal with the dignity of the goddess, daughter of the sun, and patron saint of the home."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/chair,Chair ,"This chair was part of an astonishing collection of antiquities formed between 1819 and 1824 by Henry Salt (then British consul in Egypt), acquired by the Louvre in 1826 on the advice of Jean-François Champollion. Nothing, however, is known of where it was found. While it is of a type very common in the New Kingdom, its proportions and state of preservation are exceptional."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/chalice-form-lotus,Chalice in the form of a lotus ,"This drinking-cup in bright-blue faience, with its molded decoration, is by no means a commonplace object. If it were indeed once used for drinking, it would have been exceptional in its rich decoration. Yet its form is not to be found among the ritual vessels represented in traditional religious scenes."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/chandelier,Chandelier ,"This bronze chandelier, intended to hang in a church, consists of a cylinder bearing a Greek inscription, ""Maria, daughter of Levi,"" surmounted by removable branches in the form of dolphins holding drip glasses, or small containers for oil. Suspended from three long chains, it would have shed a bright circle of light inside the building, far outshining in intensity the more commonplace terracotta lamps with a single spout."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/chapel-tomb-akhethotep,Chapel of the tomb of Akhethotep ,"The Louvre launches its new crowdfunding campaign to reconstruct the mastaba chapel of Akhethotep from October 11, 2016 to January 31, 2017. Join the campaign at "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/chelidonas-coffin,Chelidona's Coffin ,"This coffin, created from several recycled boards that were skillfully assembled, has the same form as the pharaonic coffin with corner posts. The deceased, Chelidona, which means ""swallow"" in Greek, is depicted bedecked in jewelry, while the casket itself is decorated with many images, along with two inscriptions: one in demotic script, and the other in Greek."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/christ-and-abbot-mena,Christ and Abbot Mena ,"This exceptional painting on wood comes from the monastery of Bawit in Middle Egypt. Dated to the 8th century, it represents Christ (easily recognizable by his halo with a cross) and Abbot Mena, the superior of the monastery at the time. The abbot holds a scroll in his left hand; this may have contained the rules of his monastery."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/coffin-cover-king-antef-sekhemre-herouhermaat,Coffin cover of King Antef Sekhemrê Herouhermaât ,"The coffin cover of Antef Sekhemrê Herouhermaât represents the king as a mummy wrapped in a shroud decorated with two large winged figures. On his head the dead sovereign is wearing the pleated cloth headdress known as a ""nemes,"" adorned with feathers. A broad necklace with fasteners in the shape of falcon heads covers his chest. The relatively rudimentary depiction of the body and face, as well as the brightly colored design, give this royal coffin a rather crude appearance. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/colossal-statue-ramesses-ii,Colossal statue of Ramesses II ,"This statue represents a king, sitting on a throne covered in inscriptions in the name of Ramesses II. The original identity of this work was the subject of much heated debate: traces of modifications to the crown, face, torso, and throne were long thought to indicate that the king had re-used an older work. It is almost certain, however, that these changes resulted from the monument being moved to another site during the course of the great pharaoh's sixty-seven-year reign."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/comb,Comb ,"Despite its many missing teeth, this comb has retained its full value by virtue of its central scene, still virtually intact. It features three figures, with a Greek inscription above and below, together depicting a dance or poetry competition."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cosmetic-spoon,Cosmetic spoon ,"Is there anyone who has not seen one of these pretty, carved wooden figurines in an art book? They are called ""the swimmer spoons,"" as some of them are holding a duck with hinged wings that open to reveal a spoon. This charming work - one of the most famous in the Egyptian department - has far more meaning than first meets the eye."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/couple-wood,Couple in wood ,"Despite its extensive damage, this statue of a couple walking is one of the masterpieces of wooden statuary from the Old Kingdom. The two figures are standing side by side, the woman to the right of the man. She is much smaller, and, according to the conventions of Egyptian art, is slightly behind her partner; her left arm is wrapped tenderly around her husband's waist."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cubit-rod-rule-maya-treasurer-tutankhamun,"Cubit rod (rule) of Maya, treasurer of Tutankhamun ","The recording of the harvest and the annual survey of agricultural land after the Nile flood, which displaced the marker stones, were two of the foundations of Egyptian bureaucracy. The unit of length was the cubit (of approximately 52.5 cm), and this is a particularly well-preserved cubit rod, which bears the name of a high official, Maya, royal treasurer under Tutankhamun and Horemheb."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/cupids-picking-grapes,Cupids Picking Grapes ,"This large tapestry is exceptional for its size and imagery. Despite the fact that many pieces are missing, the original composition of the overall piece can be restored. The theme of the figurative scroll presents cupids picking grapes, a favorite image in the Greco-Roman world."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/dagger-gebel-el-arak,Dagger from Gebel el-Arak ,"This unique dagger from the late predynastic period consists of a light silex blade, sculpted using a highly sophisticated technique, and an ivory handle featuring carved bas-relief scenes. It is one of the oldest known examples of bas-relief sculpture. The themes come from Nilotic as well as Mesopotamian traditions: animals, the hunt, lions overwhelmed by a figure, boats, and human combats."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/detachable-headrest,Detachable headrest ,"Although the headrest or ""bed-head"" is hardly used in the modern world, this little furniture item looks surprisingly modern, practical, and elegant-as do many pieces of furniture from Pharaonic Egypt."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/divine-standard,Divine standard ,"This bronze, topped with a sculpture in the round representing a mother cat and three lively kittens, was the upper part of a divine standard. The cat was first welcomed into Egyptian homes because of its hunting skills, but soon became a household pet. It was also associated with various deities, including the goddess Bast; from the Third Intermediate Period, it became the subject of many offerings to the goddess in the form of bronze statuettes which were placed in her temple. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/door-lintel,Door lintel ,"This lintel was found in 1927 by F. Bisson de la Roque, in the temple dedicated to the god Montu at Medamud, in Upper Egypt. It had been re-used in the foundations of the current temple and was lying face down on the ground, which explains the excellent state of preservation of the delicate relief. It entered the Louvre in 1930 subsequent to the division of excavation finds. It represents a complete and exemplary scene of a king making an offering to a god."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/eagle-censer,Eagle censer ,"This large censer consists of a cassolette and metal lacework dome. The feet and top of the object are decorated with animals. Three hares support the lower section, while the eagle, its wings fully deployed, sits atop the piece. It holds a serpent in its beak, a unique feature in Coptic art. Although fragile, this extremely elegant piece is in good condition."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/false-door-stele-sheshi,False Door on the Stele of Sheshi ,"The false door provided a way by which the deceased could pass from the world of the dead to the world of the living. This important functional element in Egyptian tombs therefore also served a magical purpose. This chapel was part of the tomb's superstructure and was accessible to the living, as opposed to an underground section containing the body of the deceased that was walled in during the burial ceremonies. This stele belonged to a dignitary from the Old Kingdom, Sheshi."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/female-nude,Female Nude ,"This little statuette is one of a series of ivory figurines dated by scholars to circa the Early Dynastic Period. Although most have a tenon beneath the feet, it is not known to what they were fixed, and their purpose thus remains unknown. In the absence of any context of discovery, the probable date of the sculpture has been deduced from stylistic features."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/figurine-naked-woman,Figurine of a naked woman ,"This delightful statuette resembles a bright blue faience doll. Its elegant nudity and totally unrealistic color make it an attractive object, but the raison d'être of this anonymous character, fashioned without legs, remains something of a mystery."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/figurine-seated-woman,Figurine of a seated woman ,"Although it is damaged, this female figurine, sitting on a stool, is worthy of interest as her clothing evokes the fashions of the Byzantine Period. Every item of her outfit is well known: rolled headband (for holding a veil), long dress adorned with tapestry motifs, and slipper-style shoes. This figurine - a toy or ex-voto - featured among the grave goods unearthed from a cemetery at Antinoe."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/foundation-deposit-temple-deir-el-bahri,Foundation deposit from the temple of Deir el-Bahri ,"Foundation deposits, such as these models of building tools, were buried prior to the construction of a temple or royal tomb—and sometimes of a fortress, palace, or city. Samples of materials used (bricks, stones) and miniature tools (axes, hoes, etc) commemorated the construction work, while vases evoked the food offerings required by the cult. The materials varied over the years."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/four-baboons-adoring-rising-sun,Four baboons adoring the rising sun ,"This 5.7-ton block formed part of the base of one of the obelisks of the temple at Luxor: it comes from the back of the one that remains there, whose twin is on the Place de la Concorde in Paris. On their arrival in Paris, the Louvre's baboons, standing on their hind legs and lifting their arms to honor the sun, caused a scandal that seems somewhat amusing today."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/four-vases-name-ramesses-ii,Four vases with the name of Ramesses II ,"These four, bright-blue glazed vases are in extremely good condition. They entered the Louvre collection as ""canopic"" recipients, designed to contain the embalmed viscera of the great king Ramesses II. Several recent studies have brought to light their long history from the temple to the necropolis."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/fragment-funerary-shroud-called-portrait-ammonios,"Fragment of a funerary shroud, called ""Portrait of Ammonios"" ","The portrait on this shroud fragment is painted on a light-colored background. An ankh sign and a crouching god are placed on either side of the head. The young man's highly individual features make this portrait a striking one. His face is very long, with a prominent chin. He holds a wine goblet in his right hand; in his left, the rose-petal crown which signified that the deceased had been judged free from sin, and would be granted access to the afterlife. There are two rings on the left hand."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/fragment-votive-monument-names-two-women-named-ta-di-imhotep,Fragment of a votive monument in the names of two women named Ta-di-Imhotep ,"Despite the austere and fragmentary appearance of this monument, it is an exceptional example of female images from the final Egyptian dynasties. In addition, it is one of three objects in the Department of Egyptian Antiquities that was reproduced in the famous Description de l’Egypte."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/fragment-book-dead-papyrus-djedhor-working-fields-afterlife,Fragment of the Book of the Dead on Papyrus: Djedhor Working in the Fields of the Afterlife ,"After death, Egyptians hoped to reach a sort of paradise they called the Fields of Offerings - a land of abundance where barley was five cords (2.5 meters!) high, and wheat seven cords (3.5 meters) high. Chapter 110 of the Book of the Dead, a papyrus scroll, is illustrated with a map of this ideal countryside; the right to enter guaranteed prosperity and protected against hunger."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/fragment-hunting-palette,Fragment of the Hunting Palette ,"The so-called ""Hunting Palette"" is among the objects that feature the earliest Egyptian bas-reliefs from the late predynastic period. These were large votive stone slabs with a central circular shape. One side of this stone is decorated with a hunting scene. The clothes, weapons, and certain symbols would be recurrent themes throughout the pharaonic civilization."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-figurine-ramesses-iv,Funerary figurine of Ramesses IV ,"This funerary figurine was made for the pharaoh Ramesses IV. The proportions, the sculpting of the face, and the design of the text are beautifully crafted. Yet this period is often viewed as the start of the decline of Egypt. Although Ramesses IV ruled for only a short time, he continued the temple restoration campaign started by his father, Ramesses III, by supporting and increasing the number of the royal craftsmen at Deir el-Medina."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-furniture-chancellor-nakhti-s-tomb,Funerary furniture from Chancellor Nakhti's tomb ,"The Louvre has half of the funerary furniture discovered in the untouched tomb of the Chancellor Nakhti, thanks to the policy of dividing excavation finds. This accumulation - nested sarcophagi, a beautiful statue carved from an acacia trunk, small models of storehouses and barks, mock weapons and toiletry items, mummy jewelry - seems odd, but according to religious beliefs, was essential to the deceased, who needed these objects in the afterlife."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-hanging,Funerary hanging ,"On this large linen cloth are painted three figures, standing on the solar bark. Anubis, god of embalming, enfolds the deceased in the garment of the living, symbolizing the latter’s transformation into Osiris, on his right. Beside his head, a shaduf symbolizes the water needed for his survival. The purely Egyptian rendering of the figure of Anubis and the Hellenistic depictions of the deceased and of Osiris exemplify the mixed style characteristic of the art of Roman Egypt."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-statue-priestess-isis,Funerary Statue of a Priestess of Isis ,"This funerary portrait shows the deceased as a priestess of Isis. A niche figure carved in high relief, it seems to have come from a mausoleum at Oxyrhynchos, an Egyptian city built during the Roman period, 300 kilometers south of Alexandria."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-stele-0,Funerary stele ,"This wooden stele in the form of the ankh, the symbol of life, was created during the Pharaonic period. A Coptic text, which attributes the stele to a certain Pantoleos, who died in the early tenth century AD, is engraved on three of its sides. The stele is interesting both in terms of the materials used and its shape."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/funerary-stele-father-and-his-son,Funerary stele of a father and his son ,"This is an example of the iconography typical of funerary steles from Abydos, showing Anubis presenting the deceased to Osiris. Here, a justified father and son, each of whom has an Anubis in the role of guardian angel, are being presented to Osiris, god of the underworld and lord of Abydos."

The two protagonists of this epitaph are represented beneath a double arch, in an attitude of prayer for all eternity. The priest and his sister, who died in April, hold up their unusually large hands to God - signs of their fervor, or of the sculptor's incompetence?"
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/furniture-leg-form-nude-woman,Furniture leg in the form of a nude woman ,"Many examples of ancient Egyptian furniture still exist, preserved by the hot dry climage of the Nile Valley. This one, a simple furniture leg, is an exceptional piece of elaborate carving, made from a branch of ebony. It probably comes from Napata, the capital of Nubia, rather than Egypt. This city was downriver from the fourth cataract of the Nile. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/gaia-cupids,Gaia with Cupids ,"This bas-relief was no doubt a lintel adorning a building which is unknown to us. A richly-adorned female bust is framed by a heavy plant wreath upheld by two winged Cupids. The attributes of the central figure - a plant headdress, a bouquet of fruit and foliage, and baskets overflowing with the fruits of the earth - suggest a representation of Gaia, the Greek earth goddess. Coptic art perpetuated the memory of the Hellenistic past."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/game-board-form-hippopotamus,Game board in the form of a hippopotamus ,"The ancient Egyptians left much evidence of the games they played. This game board, however, is unique, both in its novel hippopotamus form and in the sophistication of its material, a fine faience inlaid with brilliant colors. The back of the board has the fifty-eight holes used for playing a game that was popular throughout the whole of the ancient Middle East."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/game-box-name-imenmes,Game box in the name of Imenmes ,"From the New Kingdom onward, the track for the game of Senet was usually engraved on the surface of a wooden box featuring a drawer for the playing pieces, while in previous periods the game seems to have been an integral part of a low table. Funerary scenes show the tomb owner seated at a tall pedestal table on which the game box is placed. On the underside of this particular box (as of many others) is a grid for the game of ""Twenty Squares"" which had recently been imported from the Near East."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/gilded-cartonnage-lady-tasheret-pa-ankh,Gilded cartonnage of the lady Tasheret-pa-ankh ,"The lady Tasheret-pa-ankh was surely no ordinary person: her mummy had a protective casing entirely covered in gold leaf, a cartonnage composed of several layers of plastered linen. This is a fine example of Egyptian funerary equipment of the Greek period. It is decorated in relief with religious scenes and ritual and biographical inscriptions."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/great-sphinx-tanis,Great Sphinx of Tanis ,"The sphinx is a fabulous creature with the body of a lion and the head of a king. This one was successively inscribed with the names of the pharaohs Ammenemes II (12th Dynasty, 1929-1895 BC), Merneptah (19th Dynasty, 1212-02 BC) and Shoshenq I (22nd Dynasty, 945-24 BC). According to archaeologists, certain details suggest that this sphinx dates to an earlier period - the Old Kingdom (c. 2600 BC)."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/guardian-lion-entrance-chapel-serapeum-saqqara,Guardian Lion at the Entrance to a Chapel of the Serapeum of Saqqara ,"This lion, which looks like a large cat at rest, does not comply with the usual image we hold of the fearsome Egyptian sphinx. This unusual sculpture, created under the reign of Amenophis III circa 1400-1350 BC, is best known through statues from the fourth century BC or later. The Louvre's lion, which comes from the Serapeum of Saqqara, forms a pair with a symmetrical lion that once greeted visitors at the first pylon of the temple."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/head-colossal-statue-amenophis-iii,Head of a colossal statue of Amenophis III ,"This head represents Amenophis III as the king of Upper Egypt. It belonged to one of the granite colossi erected by the king in his temple at Kom el-Hettan, whose entrance was flanked by the Colossi of Memnon. This temple, now in ruins, was once adorned with a great wealth of statuary."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/head-sphinx-king-djedefre,Head of a sphinx of King Djedefre ,"Djedefre, son and successor of Cheops, is less well known than his father or his brother Khafre. He did not have his pyramid built on the famous Giza plateau as they did, but eight kilometers to the north at Abu Roash. This portrait was among the thousands of fragments of statues and architectural remains found in the early 20th century by the French Institute of Oriental Archaeology, during excavations in the ruins of his pyramid temple."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/hippopotamus-figurine,Hippopotamus figurine ,"This benevolent-looking hippopotamus slips into the marshes, taking on their colour and half-engulfed in water plants. Bright-blue Egyptian faience figures of hippopotami such as this were placed in the tombs of high-ranking civil servants toward the end of the Middle Kingdom."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/hoe,Hoe ,"The hoe, the basic implement for working the earth, is still used in Egypt today. This multifunctional tool played an important role in a country where survival depended on agriculture and irrigation. This one, composed of two wooden elements and a piece of rope, thus provides fascinating evidence of everyday life in ancient Egypt."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/horus,Horus ,"Originally, this bronze statue of the god Horus was covered with precious materials; inlays of glass or colored faience; and gilt coating or gold plate, to evoke the eternal indestructible flesh of the gods. These elements also concealed the joints between the various sections cast using the lost-wax technique. The statue has no text, but the style and craftsmanship date the work to the Third Intermediate Period."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/horus-horseback,Horus on horseback ,"This object was obviously designed as part of a window. The subject of the sculpture is highly original and reflects the blending of Egyptian and Greco-Roman traditions. A horseman, who is none other than the god Horus, is stabbing his spear into a crocodile, the animal that symbolized the god Setekh. This strange combat represents the victory of Good over Evil."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/hypocephalus-irethorrou,Hypocephalus of Irethorrou ,"This odd disk, covered with strange images and texts, is known as ""hypocephalus,"" a Greek word for ""that which is below the head,"" in reference to the object's funerary function. This unusual religious pillow enabled the deceased to identify himself to the sun god by the flash of light it created."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/imhotep-wise-deified,Imhotep the Wise Deified ,"Few individuals in Egypt rose to the status of a god. Yet Imhotep, a brilliant statesmen from the Third Dynasty, was one of them. This wise man designed the first pyramid for his king, Djoser, in the mid-twenty-seventh century BC. Venerated during the New Kingdom as the ""patron saint"" of scribes, deified in the seventh century BC, and considered the protector of scholars and doctors, he was often portrayed as a scribe. This statue depicts a seated priest with a papyrus unrolled on his knees."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/inventory-and-accounts-temple-abusir,Inventory and accounts from a temple of Abusir ,"These archives, discovered in the 19th century in Abusir, are among the oldest known hieratic papyri. Employee tasks, inventories, and especially accounts were noted daily or monthly on records. One of these two fragments provides a detailed inventory of cult vases; the other, a monthly summary of deliveries of goods."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/jar-portrait,Jar with portrait ,"This large biconical storage jar was no doubt half-buried, with only the upper part showing. The typically Coptic decoration shows a couple of lions attacking a gazelle (or an onager), with fish, birds, and a female bust among berry-bearing plants."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/jonah-wall-hanging,Jonah wall-hanging ,"This tapestry, in linen and wool, features a highly complex chromatic composition. It is part of a series, many copies of which have been found in Middle Egypt. The Louvre version combines two allusions to the Resurrection of Christ (the Biblical story of Jonah, and a representation of a peacock holding a cross, or ankh, in its beak), with a lavishly-adorned complex cross, asserting the triumph of Christianity."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/khabekhent-s-funerary-servant-and-ushabti-chest,Khabekhent's funerary servant and ushabti chest ,"Khabekhent's funerary servant and chest were discovered in 1886 in the untouched tomb of his father, Sennedjem, in Deir el-Medina. Although the village craftsmen had few statuettes, the quality of those that remain illustrate their social standing and expertise. The chest is shaped like an archaic chapel from Lower Egypt. The decorated surface features the deceased, smelling a lotus, and his heavily bejeweled wife, both sitting under a canopy. The style is in keeping with the lavish decoration."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/knucklebones,Knucklebones ,"Knucklebones, like throwsticks, featured among the accessories for board games, and were used by players to determine how far their pieces could move along the track. They were not Egyptian in origin, but were imported from the Near East from the early New Kingdom onward."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/kohl-pot-form-nubian-porter,Kohl pot in the form of a Nubian porter ,This little kohl pot in the form of a servant is an excellent example of the taste of the refined society that developed in the New Kingdom. Wealthy people took great care over their toilet. They also enjoyed surrounding themselves with elegant objects and reminders of their own privileges.
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/kohl-recipient-god-bes,Kohl Recipient: the god Bes ,"The figurine has lost its feet and plinth, which have now been replaced by a modern base. The earrings and the pivoting top of this kohl recipient are also missing. These objects were often made in the form of the god Bes, who protected the valuable contents. The palette of bright colors that sparkle against the white background is especially remarkable in that it was created with metal oxides."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/krater,Krater ,"This vessel is an example of Egyptian craftsmanship from the early Roman period; the form was derived from a Greek prototype, the material of Egyptian invention. The decoration consists of stylized plant motifs created from a basic element: a small, bright blue-green leaf, which stands out against a dark purple ground."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/large-bottle-vine-leaf-decoration,Large bottle with vine-leaf decoration ,"This large, two-tone pottery bottle was found in a grave in Sedeinga in Sudan, in a cemetery dating from the Meroitic period. Painted ceramics were an important feature of the art of this civilization, which grew up between the Second and Sixth Cataracts of the Nile and lasted from the Hellenistic period through the Late Roman Empire."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/large-statue-chancellor-nakhti,Large statue of Chancellor Nakhti ,"The sculptor worked with a single trunk of high-grade acacia to create this life-size statue of Nakhti. An inscription written around the base consists of hieroglyphs indicating the high-ranking status of the figure, recognized in the world of the dead and the living."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/legging,Legging ,"This elaborately decorated legging was discovered in a tomb in Middle Egypt. Far from Egyptian in style, featuring as it does iconographic themes of foreign origin, it is nevertheless almost certainly of Egyptian manufacture. It depicts a battle scene, unfortunately highly fragmented, with archers and a Persian king."

Women are depicted gathering lily flowers, extracting their juice by squeezing them in a strip of cloth twisted between two sticks, then presenting it to the owner of the tomb: Païrkep, known as Psametikmerneith."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mask-woman,Mask of a Woman ,"This mask, representing the face of a Greek woman, was placed over the mummy's face. Originally polychromatic, it was cast in plaster and hollow on the inside; during the Roman period, this type of mask replaced the pharaonic mask. It served the same purpose as the portraits of mummies painted on wood."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mortuary-mask-khaemwaset,Mortuary Mask of Khaemwaset ,"Not all the gold funerary masks of Egypt are as splendid as Tutankhamen's. That of Khaemwaset, son of Ramesses II, is a case in point. The thin sheet of gold leaf (one-tenth of a millimeter thick) has irregular edges and crudely reproduces the shape of a fairly chubby and unattractive face; the eyes and mouth are rendered clearly, and the ears stick out. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-painted-shroud,Mummy in painted shroud ,The painted shroud is wrapped tightly around the mummy and the wood plank on which it rests. The portrait represents a young man inside a naos coffin. A painted mesh pattern covers the body from the waist to the calves. X-ray examinations reveal that the boy probably died at the age of 16 or 17. This is a rare example from Antinoe of a painted shroud still wrapped around a mummy.
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-label,Mummy Label ,"The mummy label is an emblematic funerary object from the Roman era in Egypt. Attached to the mummy, it was the deceased's identification and passport to eternity. A portrait of the deceased, with an epitaph in Greek, was depicted on one side, while a standard prayer formula in demotic script graced the other."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-mask,Mummy Mask ,"Ancient Egyptian men are generally thought of as having been clean-shaven, but beards and moustaches are quite frequently found on statues and mummy masks in collections the world over. They were more common towards the end of the Old Kingdom and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom. In the tombs of the Assiut cemetery, which date from the Middle Kingdom, several mummy masks have these features."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-mask-boy,Mummy mask of a boy ,"This mummy mask depicts a young boy with a thin face and pointed chin. The colors are well preserved. The boy's large eyes are painted and incised in the stucco, and his hair is cut short. He wears a long-sleeved white tunic decorated with purple vertical stripes. In his right hand he holds a wreath of rose petals, and in his right a papyrus scroll."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-mask-man-headrest,Mummy mask of a man with headrest ,"This mummy mask shows a man with gray hair, beard and moustache, dressed in white, with a panel of his fringed mantle falling to the right. He has a ring on the little finger of his left hand. On his head is a wreath, probably of myrtle leaves. The head was modeled in stucco over a wooden core attached to the panel. On the headrest, which held the mummy's head, the dead man is painted as Osiris, with Isis, Nephthys and the four sons of Horus in attendance. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-mask-woman,Mummy mask of a woman ,"This is a portrait of a young woman. The fine features of her rather fleshy face are carefully modeled and painted, and the hairstyle is simple. She is portrayed wearing a blue tunic with purple clavii, and a cloak that covers the back of her neck. Her many pieces of heavy jewelry were originally gilded with gold leaf. She holds the Osirian crown of justification in her right hand, and in her left, ears of corn and poppies, which were associated with the cult of Isis Demeter."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-man,Mummy of a man ,"This extremely well preserved mummy is that of a man who lived during the Ptolemaic Period. According to the customs of the time, the body of the deceased was carefully wrapped in strips of linen; the design formed by these strips, notably around the face, was often extremely sophisticated. The mummy is covered with a cartonnage consisting of several elements: a mask covering the head, a wide collar over the chest, an apron across the legs, and finally, a casing over the feet."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-woman-portrait,Mummy of a woman with portrait ,"This young woman's portrait was fixed in place with the bandages enveloping her mummy. The meticulously arranged bandages form a rhomboidal design imitating the protective netting. There is a Greek inscription painted in black ink on the chest. X-ray analysis has shown that the deceased was a forty year-old woman, and not the young woman in the portrait, which is a depiction of her eternal youth as an Osiris."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-shroud-and-mask,Mummy shroud and mask ,"This mummy covering comprises a mask with a headboard encasing the head and bust, and five fragments of shroud enveloping the lower part of the body and the feet. The finely-made covering is remarkably beautiful, and its decoration and iconography are unique. Its role was to provide magical protection and ensure eternal life for the image of the deceased, identified with Ra. It is contemporary with the Fayum portraits, and reflects the strength of the Pharaonic funerary tradition."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/mummy-s-head,Mummy's head ,"This mummified head of a man with curly hair still bears a fragment of the linen in which it was wrapped; the face is coated with gold leaf. Mummification was thought to help the deceased attain eternal life. Because of its color, gold symbolized the sun for the Egyptians, who believed it to be ""the flesh of the gods""; mummies were not gilded until the Roman period."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/necklace-fish-pendants,Necklace with fish pendants ,"The two chains of this necklace are formed of small, interlocking rings. Three small chains, each one with a pendant - an elegant lotus flower and two small fish - hang from the rectangular clasp. This magnificent piece of jewelry is characteristic of the brilliant craftsmanship of Egyptian artists, who had mastered highly sophisticated jewelry-making techniques from the earliest eras on."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/nile-fishing-scene,Nile Fishing Scene ,"This fragment of an Old Kingdom mastaba includes a total of ten fish, all clearly identifiable and depicted with careful attention to detail, together with a frog, a hippopotamus, and a crocodile. The scene depicts the natural environment of the Nile marshes, a source of both recreation and sustenance for the tomb's noble occupant, during his life. "
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/nude-male-statuette,Nude Male Statuette ,"The relatively large numbers of human representations from the late predynastic period in Egypt are not always highly detailed or very realistic, and we do not know their purpose. They were discovered in tombs, when the origin is known with certainty. This male statuette is an exceptional example, due to its size and refined execution; it was dated by comparing it to another extremely similar work."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/offering-table-found-meroe,Offering table found at Meroe ,"Offering tables were blocks of sculpted stone, intended to be placed in front of the magical false doors and statues of tombs; they were fundamental items in the cult of the dead and the gods. This one is particularly rare: it comes from Meroe, capital of a kingdom located in modern Sudan, south of the fifth cataract of the Nile."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/offering-bearer,Offering-bearer ,"Standing with left foot forward, the female figure carries a basket with a leg of beef and a vessel of water. This model of a female offering-bearer comes from a tomb of the Early Middle Kingdom. The large sculpture, formed of several pieces of wood, is entirely covered in polychrome paint."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ostrakon-royal-profile,Ostrakon with a royal profile ,"This piece of limestone, which is decorated on both sides, is called an ostakon (plural: ostraka), from the Greek word for ""shell."" Modern archeologists use this word to designate pottery shards or flakes of limestone inscribed with texts or images. Egyptian artists used ostraka for sketches or preliminary drawings."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/paintings-tomb-metjetji,Paintings from the tomb of Metjetji ,"As if by miracle, we can still admire fragments of a decoration that was painted on the mud and straw walls of an Egyptian tomb some 4300 years ago. The funerary cult of a high-ranking official and scenes of country life on his estate are brought back to life by these painted scenes. In the bird hunting scene, one of the ancient artists demonstrated particular virtuosity."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/paintings-tomb-unsu,Paintings from the tomb of Unsu ,"This fragment forms part of a group of mural paintings that decorated the chapel in the tomb of the scribe Unsu, grain accountant in the temple of the god Amun. The scenes depicted here show the succession of agricultural operations which Unsu had to supervise: plowing, sowing, harvesting, and the treading of the corn to separate the grain from the ear. The images read from the bottom up."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pair-clappers,Pair of clappers ,"These objects are curved like boomerangs; each end is decorated with the head of the goddess Hathor and a slender hand. These musical instruments are known as clappers, and they were used in pairs. The sound produced by striking these two elements together replaced hand clapping as a way of creating a rhythm for music and accompanying dances."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pair-sandals,Pair of sandals ,"This pair of sandals was probably unearthed from the cemetery at Panopolis, no doubt from the tomb of a woman. The flat leather sole is richly decorated. Two broad burgundy leather straps cross over the instep, and there is a third, central strap to which the thong between the toes must originally have been attached. A leather circle is sewn onto the junction of the straps with plant fibers wrapped in a leather thong. The richly-decorated leather indicates that this was luxury footwear."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/palm-column-name-king-unas,Palm column in the name of King Unas ,"This palm column once adorned the peristyle courtyard of the funerary temple of King Unas (2380-2350 BC) at Saqqara. It evokes the prestigious setting of the royal funerary temple adjoining the eastern façade of the pyramid, where the priests in charge of the cult officiated and served the offerings intended to ensure the dead king's survival in the afterlife."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/panel-virgin-annunciate,Panel of the Virgin Annunciate ,"This fragment of a wood panel depicts a bas-relief of the Virgin Annunciate. This image, which is rare in Coptic art, is interesting both for the expression of the Virgin and the direct communication established between the viewer and the object. This extremely refined work is one of the masterpieces of the Louvre's Coptic Rooms."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/panel-portrait-man,Panel portrait of a man ,"The bust of the deceased stands out against a yellow ocher background painted onto a piece of rough canvas cut into the shape of a niche. The head - the only element portrayed in relief - is made of compressed, stuccoed linen. At the bottom of the panel, below a garland, is a painted representation of the boat of the god Sokaris, guarded by two jackals. Panel portraits of this type represent the final evolution of this funerary tradition."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/patera,Patera ,"A patera was a bowl for the washing of hands before and after eating. In Coptic Egypt they were often lavishly decorated; in this instance the decor is concentrated on the perimeter of the bowl (with beads streaming from the mouths of two dolphins), and on the handle (with a naked female figure wearing an open-work cross). The movement of the two animals and the woman's legs create a powerful dynamic, making this one of the finest Egyptian pateras of this period."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pendant-name-king-osorkon-ii-god-osiris-s-family,Pendant with the Name of King Osorkon II:  the God Osiris's Family ,"This extremely precious solid gold and lapis lazuli item of jewelry - a true masterpiece of antique goldwork - represents the holy triad of the Osiris family. Despite the presence of the god of death, this piece was more a temple treasure than a funerary jewel."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pendant-falcon-ram-s-head,"Pendant, Falcon with Ram's Head ","This pendant comes from the tomb of an Apis bull buried in the Serapeum of Saqqara, a site excavated by Auguste Mariette from 1851 to 1853. Made from gold of great purity, it takes the form of a falcon with a ram's head, with outstretched wings and legs and wearing a broad necklace. Engraved on the reverse of the gold leaf, the image appears on the front in relief and in colored cloisonné. This is a composite figure of a deity, almost certainly a form of the sun god."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pilgrim-flasks,Pilgrim flasks ,"Pilgrim flasks, or ampullae, are small metal, glass, or terra vials such as this one, used by pilgrims in Antiquity and in the early Middle Ages, to carry home water or oil from the lamps burning in the sanctuaries visited. They also held oil that had been placed near the relics of a martyr and even earth scooped up piously from around a worshiped tomb."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pillar-said-be-bawit,Pillar said to be from Bawit ,"This pillar, said to be from Bawit, is richly decorated on two adjacent faces and was no doubt a corner stone or door jamb. The meticulous relief decoration consists of geometric motifs and luxuriant foliage populated by birds; it is completed by two drapery-clad figures in the rectangular frames at the top of the pillar: an archangel and an apostle."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pinudjem-s-necklace,Pinudjem's Necklace ,"This splendid gold necklace is of exceptional quality and great originality. It consists of three chains composed of flat rings that are soldered together in pairs, and a rectangular pendant inlaid with lapis lazuli, that bears the name of Pinudjem I framed by two bees. Smaller chains, adorned with elegant floral pendants, are attached to the outer and inner chain and to the bottom of the rectangular pendant. This lovely necklace demonstrates the virtuosity of the goldsmiths of the period."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/portrait-man-1,Portrait of a man ,"The man is represented in a three-quarters pose against a dark gray background. His face is dark and his clothing light. The oval face is elongated, which accentuates the hair that tapers to a point on the forehead, leaving the temples bare. The hair is cut very short, with a clear contour around the face. The man is dressed simply in a white tunic with a purple clavii."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/portrait-woman,Portrait of a woman ,"The young woman is portrayed almost full face, her bust turned slightly to the left. She is wearing a dark tunic with green clavi, and a dark mantle over her left shoulder. Her hair is parted in two bands which cover her ears. She has a braid on top of her head and a row of little ringlets framing her forehead. Her lips are particularly well defined, and she has a dimple on her chin."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/portrait-woman-known-l-europeenne,"Portrait of a woman, known as ""L'Européenne"" ","The youthful face stands out against a blue-gray background. Shown almost frontally, its perfect oval is set off by the regular lines of the drawn-back hair and the semicircle of the plait, from which emerges the gold head of a hairpin. The pearly flesh-tints with their pink touches are applied in small close-packed strokes. The large eyes look to the right, brought to life by two touches of white. Gold leaf hides a slender neck adorned by a pearl necklace."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/processional-way-sphinxes,Processional Way of Sphinxes ,"Several hundred sphinxes similar to this one once lined the processional way to the Serapis Temple (the Serapeum in Saqqara), which no longer exists. This sanctuary, a major pilgrimage site in late antiquity, was once very famous. All that remains today is its underground structures: the necropolis of the Apis bulls begun during the reign of Ramesses II. Mariette determined the location of the temple as the walkway was cleared, one sphinx at a time."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/pyxis-or-pyx,Pyxis or pyx ,"This fragmentary piece is a pyxis or pyx, a cylindrical box designed to hold the consecrated host. The decorations on such boxes are extremely varied. On the left side of this one is an upright mummy-like figure, a very common image in Christian art in Egypt."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/queen-cleopatra-making-offering-goddess-isis,Queen Cleopatra Making an Offering to the Goddess Isis ,"This limestone stele was dedicated to Cleopatra VII Philopator on 2 July 51 BC by Onnophris, the Greek ""president of the association of Isis Snonais."" This association of temples was placed under the protection of a form of the goddess Isis worshiped in Faiyum (Al-Fayyum). Surprisingly, to modern eyes, the celebrated Egyptian queen is represented here as a traditional, male sovereign."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/queen-khenemet-nefer-hedjet-great,"Queen Khenemet-Nefer-Hedjet ""the Great"" ","In 1997, the Louvre acquired a new royal statue from the Middle Kingdom. The complete name of the person represented, Khenemet-Nefer-Hedjet-Weret, identifies her as the wife of Sesostris II and the mother of Sesostris III. It is an extremely rare monument, as no more than a dozen statues of queens from this era have been found. Furthermore, the work is intact."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/queen-tiye,Queen Tiye ,"Queen Tiye, the Great Royal Wife of Amenhotep III, once stood beside the king, of whom only the right arm remains. The royal couple was carved from a block of very soft stone called steatite, and embellished with bright green enamel."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ram-pendant,Ram Pendant ,"This richly decorated piece of jewelry would originally have formed part of a breastplate of which there now remains only the central section. It shows, in profile, a god whose body is wrapped in a shroud, with a ram's head and wearing a composite crown: the representation of a creator god. He is seated on a lotus flower. A great Egyptian myth tells how the sun emerged from a lotus flower on the first morning of creation."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ramesses-ii-breastplate,Ramesses II Breastplate ,"Auguste Mariette discovered this breastplate, named for Ramesses II, in 1852 during excavations of the Serapeum in Saqqara, under the coffin of a tomb of an Apis bull. The shape - a temple pylon with a cloisonné and openwork design - is traditional for this type of jewelry from the mid-Twelfth Dynasty (circa 1850 BC). The deities represented inside the architectural frame were intended to protect the amulet's wearer."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/recipient-bowls,Recipient with bowls ,"This large dish with a round base consists of a central bowl surrounded by six smaller bowl shapes. The spaces between the outer bowls are decorated with stylized images of trees. This type of recipient involved a three-step production: the round dish was thrown on a potter's wheel; the openings were cut out; and finally, the smaller bowl shapes were formed, fitted into the openings, and attached using a clay slip. This dish was designed to hold various condiments."

These tombs date from the early 18th Dynasty. Although they belonged to a class that was modest if not poor, they contained a wealth of material: everyday objects that had been used by the owners during their lifetime."

The jars are made of high quality red ceramic and feature a remarkable relief carving of two arms, one of which holds the ankh symbol, the other a uas scepter. These are the oldest canopic jars in the Louvre."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/relief-temple-monthu-tod,Relief from the temple of Monthu at Tod ,"The late 11th Dynasty witnessed the revival, after more than two centuries, of the difficult art of bas-relief sculpture. It can be admired on vestiges from one of the earliest stages of construction of the temple at Tod. This bas-relief and the blocks that are exhibited beside it were found buried beneath the foundation sand of the later sanctuary, which explains why they escaped the fate of most limestone works: disappearing into the lime kilns."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ring-horemheb,Ring of Horemheb ,"This solid gold signet ring is exceptional for its size and the quality of its workmanship. Spirals are added toward the rounded ends of the very thick ring, and the four faces of the rectangular, rotating bezel are deeply engraved with a crocodile, a scorpion, a lion, and the coronation name of Horemheb, the last king of the 18th Dynasty."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ring-horses,Ring with horses ,"This precious piece of jewelry is commonly known as the ""ring with horses"", because of the two extraordinarily lifelike little horses that prance across its setting. It is a unique design of great technical virtuosity - a veritable masterpiece of New Kingdom gold metalwork. The diameter of the ring and the horse motif suggest that it was designed for a man."
https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/royal-and-divine-triad,Royal and divine triad ,"The three statues, carved from a single block of granite, stand in a traditional side-by-side position. The god Osiris is portrayed in the center, holding scepters and wrapped in a shroud, with the falcon-headed god Horus on one side and the symmetrical representation of a king on the other. This monument bears no inscriptions, but is attributed to a 19th-Dynasty king -perhaps Ramesses II, or Merneptah."
